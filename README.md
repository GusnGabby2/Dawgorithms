Project Title: Dawgorithm
Team Members: Chloe Malimban, Braden Coghlan, Josh Lumogdang, and Marion Manalo
Purpose: Full-stack implementation of a club management platform that uses API’s, authentication, and databases with the goal of garnering interests for clubs. Users sign in with the school email addresses to be sorted into their respective college. From there, users can create their own clubs, with the ability to add descriptions and images, or join clubs made by others.
Tools/Framework Utilized:
- MongoDB Atlas
- Vercel
- Render
- React
- Next.js
- Node.js
Challenges:
- Determining scope in theory vs. in practicality: We decided to start small and focus on implementing the most simple features, then possibly adding more later if we have time.
- Properly deploying and connecting backend and frontend: As only one member had strong prior experience working with full-stack development, we were concerned that we would not be able to have the time to ensure that everything worked. Fortunately, the process was nearly seamless.
- Lack of appealing organization: Since each person had their own role in order to be most efficient with time, there were points where there were inconsistencies in format and style. Rather than going back and amending each individual inconsistency, we opted to prioritize functionality with the limited time we had left.
- Time pressure: While acknowledging the limited amount of time during conception of the project, we still felt quite the pressure as time constantly passed. Rather than magically “work harder” last second, we decided to make some sacrifices in feature inclusion to ensure the most important features ran smoothly and consistently. Ultimately, while we did not fully overcome this obstacle, we came to recognize that much stronger, realistic planning is a necessity for future projects.
